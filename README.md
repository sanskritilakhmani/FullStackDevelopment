shouldComponentUpdate: This method can be used to avoid unwanted re-renders for better performance. So based on the received new props, we can decide whether to update the component or not.


```
export default class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    console.log('Constructor called');
    super();

    this.state = {
      counter: 1,
    };
  }

  componentWillMount() {
    console.log('componentWillMount() called');
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('componentDidMount() called');
    setInterval(this.update, 2000);
  }

  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('componentWillUpdate() called');
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('componentDidUpdate() called');
  }

  update = () => {
    this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 });
  };
  reset = () => {
    this.setState({ counter: 0 });
  };
  render() {
    console.log('Render called');
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: 10 }}>
          {this.state.counter}
